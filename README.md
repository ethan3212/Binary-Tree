# Binary-Tree

This is a Binary Tree program written in Java. This application inserts, sorts, deletes, searches, and traverses.
When run, the user is given a choice: show the tree, insert a number, find a number, delete a number, or traverse the tree. The application will then automatically sort
and balance the tree.
